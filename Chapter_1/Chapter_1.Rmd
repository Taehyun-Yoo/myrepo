# 1.2 Why learn regression?
```{r 1.2}
hibbs <- read.table("../../ElectionsEconomy/data/hibbs.dat", header=TRUE)
hibbs

plot(hibbs$growth, hibbs$vote, xlab="Average recent growth in personal income",
     ylab="Incumbent party's vote share")

# 1.6 Computing least squares and Bayesian regression
## Types of fitting
```{r 1.6}
#1:least squares regression
fit1 <- lm(vote ~ growth, data = hibbs)
fit1
#2:maximum likelihood (maybe later)
#3:Bayesian regression
fit3 <- stan_glm(vote ~ growth, data=hibbs)
fit3
#3-1:running Bayesian regression faster using optimizing mode when dataset is large
fit3_1 <- stan_glm(vote ~ growth, data=hibbs, algorithm = "optimizing")
fit3_1
```
